 collectd - System information collection daemon
=================================================
http://verplant.org/collectd/

About
-----

  collectd is a small daemon which collects statistics about a computer's
  usage and writes then into RRD files.


Features
--------

  * collectd is able to collect the following data:

    - CPU utilization
      (Time spent in system, user, nice and idle)

    - Disk utilization
      (Sectors read/written, number of read/write actions, time spent doing IO)

    - Quota
      (User/group block/inode usage/quota/limit/grace/timeleft per filesystem.)

    - Harddisk temperatures
      (Uhm, yeah, temperature of harddisks that is ;)

    - System load
      (Load average over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes)

    - Memory utilization
      (Memory occupied by running processes, page cache, buffer cache and free)

    - NFS Procedures
      (Which NFS command were called how often. Only NFSv2 and NFSv3 right now)

    - Ping latency
      (Time to reach the default gateway or another given host)

    - Serial
      (RX and TX of serial interfaces)

    - Sensors
      (System temperatured and fan rotation speeds)

    - Swap
      (Pages swapped out onto harddisk or whatever is called `swap' by the OS..)

    - Tape
      (Read and write bytes and operations on tape devices)

    - Traffic
      (In/Outbound traffic on the interfaces)

  * Performance: Running as a daemon collectd doesn't spend much time in
    startup. Since collectd links against libping, librrd and libsensors it
    doesn't need to start any other processes.

  * Hardly any maintenance neccessary and setup is trivial.

  * Extremely easy and failsafe network operation possible.


Operation
---------

  * When running collectd writes system statistics in RRD-files. Per default
    they reside in `/var/lib/collectd'.

  * collectd needs to run as user root, since only root can craft ICMP
    packages needed to ping other hosts. collectd should NOT be installed
    setui root since it can be used to overwrite valuable files..

  * Sample scripts to generate graphs reside in `contrib/' in the source
    package or somewhere near `/usr/share/doc/collectd' in most distributions.
    Please be aware that those script are meant as a starting point for your
    own experiments.. Some of them require the `RRDs' Perl module.
    (`librrds-perl' on Debian)

  * The RRD-files that collectd creates hold the following data. Use ``rrdtool
    resize'' if you want to cover longer/shorter periods of time.

    Resolution | Data points |  Timespan
    -----------+-------------+----------
    60 seconds |        1500 |  25 hours
    30 minutes |        1680 |  35 days
     6 hours   |        1520 | 380 days

  * Use `-c' to start in client-, `-s' to start in server-mode. Read the
    manpage for details.


Prerequisites
-------------

  To compile collectd from source you will need:

  * Usual suspects: C compiler, linker, preprocessor, make, ...

  * rrdtool (headers and library; rrdtool 1.0 and 1.2 both work fine)

  * lm-sensors (optional)

  * libstatgrab may be used to collect statistics on systems other than Linux
    and/or Solaris. Note that CPU- and disk-statistics, while being provided by
    this library, are not supported in collectd right now..
