=head1 DESCRIPTION

This config file controls how the system statistics collection daemon
B<collectd> behaves. The most significant options are B<Mode>, which controlls
if the daemon will act as client, server or will be independent in local mode,
and B<LoadPlugin> which controls which plugins to load.

The syntax of this config file is similar to the config file of the famos
B<Apache Webserver>. Each line containes either a key-value-pair or a
section-start or -end. Empty lines and everything after the hash-symbol `#' is
ignored.

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<Mode> (B<Local>|B<Client>|B<Server>)

Sets the operating mode. See the section B<MODES> in L<collectd(1)> for a
description. This option determines which other options are allowed. Defaults
to B<Local>.

=item B<LoadPlugin> I<Plugin>

Loads the plugin I<Plugin>. There must be at least one such line or B<collectd>
will be mostly useless. The names of the plugins are listed in L<collectd(1)>.

=item B<PIDFile> I<File>

Sets where to write the PID file to. This file is overwritten when it exists
and deleted when the program ist stopped. Available in B<all modes>.

=item B<DataDir> I<Directory>

Sets the data directory. This is the directory beneath all RRD-files are
created. Possibly more subdirectories are created. This is also the working
directory for the daemon. Available in B<all modes>, though the B<Server> mode
won't write to this directory.

=item B<LogFile> I<File>

Sets the file to write debugging output to. This is only used if compiled with
debugging enabled. It's ignored otherwise. Available in B<all modes>.

=item B<Server> I<IP-address>

The server to send data to. B<This is not yet implemented!> Maybe a better name
for this was B<Receiver>, since I plan on detecting multicast groups
automatically. On the other hand a extra MulticastGroup-option would be of
interest for the server process. Anyhow, right now this is available for the
B<Client> mode only.

=item B<Port> I<Port-number>

(UDP-)Port to send packages to or to bind to and wait for packages. This option
is available in the B<Client> and B<Server> mode.

=head1 PLUGIN OPTIONS

Some Plugins may register own options. These options must be inclosed in a
C<Plugin>-Section. Which options exist depends on the plugin used:

=head2 Plugin C<hddtemp>

=over 4

=item B<Host> I<Hostname>

Hostname to connect to. Defaults to B<127.0.0.1>.

=item B<Port> I<Port>

TCP-Port to connect to. Defaults to B<7634>.

=back

=head2 Plugin C<mysql>

=over 4

=item B<Host> I<Hostname>

Hostname of the database server. Defaults to B<localhost>.

=item B<User> I<Username>

Username to use when connecting to the database.

=item B<Password> I<Password>

Password needed to log into the database.

=item B<Database> I<Database>

Select this database. Defaults to I<no database> which is a perfecly reasonable
option for what this plugin does.

=back

=head2 Plugin C<ping>

=over 4

=item B<Host> I<IP-address>

Host to ping periodically. This option may be repeated several times to ping
multiple hosts.
